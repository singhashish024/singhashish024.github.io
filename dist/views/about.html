				<p>Welcome to my website. I am a Front End Developer with an experience of creating responsive websites that allow the user to experience it in the best and most appropriate way suited to the device they are using. Cross browser compatibility is ensured by using feature detection so older browsers still in use today provide a solid experience.<br>Rather than creating websites on a page-by-page basis, I instead consider each element of the screen-based designs as separate components which helps in a reusable and maintainable code base.<br>I can quickly and efficiently integrate in a team with methods and tools such as Git, Agile/Scrum, and test/behaviour driven development.
