				<p>I am a 1st year student in the Biostatistics and Medical Informatics MS program at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have four years of work experience with Siemens Healthcare starting as a Software Engineer in their Imaging Team and developing annotation tools. Later, I moved into the role of Data Analyst and worked on developing Recommender Systems, Image Classifiers and Statistical Models. I am well versed in Algorithms, Data Structures, Machine Learning, Statistical Methods and Cloud Computing. <br> <br> I collaborate with peers to nurture and transform ideas into well thought out design specs.  I love coding things from scratch, but I can work with frameworks and third party libraries.
