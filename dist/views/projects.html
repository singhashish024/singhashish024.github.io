				<p>syngo.plaza is the smart PACS workhorse for reading and reporting a large variety of cases – from routine to complex. It brings 3D technology to everyday reading. And its powerful storage capacities enable vendor-neutral archiving even enterprise-wide.Designed for frequent use, syngo.plaza offers robust performance, intuitive operation, and intelligent reading tools. It is a state-of-the-art productivity driver for radiology and beyond, grows with you, and makes reading and reporting pay off – today and tomorrow.Currently this software has been successfully installed at over 1600 medical hosipitals all over the world.<br><br>Contribution: Being part of the front end development team, I have worked on improving the application's user experience. I also wrote Image Processing algorithms in C++ for extracting and rendering images in real time form PACS system.</p>

				<h1 class="w3-text-black">Contact Manager Application</h1>
				<p>This application brings a unified view of contacts biography as well as provides a way to assign tasks, track to-dos and plan follow-up activities. It helps in closely monitoring activities so that they don't slip through cracks. Instant Search functionality in the contact list helps in finding users easily.<br>This application is built using <em>HTML, CSS, AngularJS, Angular Material and Typescript</em><br>Bower is used for dependency management whereas for the version control GIT is used. Sublime text 3 is used as a text editor.</p>

				<h1 class="w3-text-black">SCADA based Protection System</h1>
				<p>The project is aimed to develop a prototype distribution system and to study the fault clearing process by using SCADA for transferring data and PLC to send the commanding signals to the protective devices such as contactors and relays. PLC acts as the main terminal unit and through ladder programming, takes the required decision to protect the system. The project will give an insight on how automation can decrease the response time and reduce the human effort, thus making the distribution network much more reliable. Binary switching has been used to operate the capacitor bank so as to obtain smooth compensation of reactive power. A Human Machine Interface has also been developed which makes the network easily understandable and accessible.<br>Softwares Used: RS Logix Pro as a primary programming software, RS Linx Classic OEM to set up communication channel and RS View 32 for HMI/MMI.<br>RS232, RS485 and Ethernet used for Communication. MODBUS used as a protocol for serial communication.</p>
