				<h1 class="w3-text-black">SCADA based Protection System</h1>
				<p>The project is aimed to develop a prototype distribution system and to study the fault clearing process by using SCADA for transferring data and PLC to send the commanding signals to the protective devices such as contactors and relays. PLC acts as the main terminal unit and through ladder programming, takes the required decision to protect the system. The project will give an insight on how automation can decrease the response time and reduce the human effort, thus making the distribution network much more reliable. Binary switching has been used to operate the capacitor bank so as to obtain smooth compensation of reactive power. A Human Machine Interface has also been developed which makes the network easily understandable and accessible.<br>Softwares Used: RS Logix Pro as a primary programming software, RS Linx Classic OEM to set up communication channel and RS View 32 for HMI/MMI.<br>RS232, RS485 and Ethernet used for Communication. MODBUS used as a protocol for serial communication.</p>
